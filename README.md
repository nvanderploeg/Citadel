## Citadel Game Engine

Citadel Game engine is a set of C++ tools designed to support the creation of fun unique game experiences.
It will eventually provide everything from a full game loop with GUI, Scenes, AI, and More,

Everything will initially be build for Mac OSX and later support for Windows, Linux, and iOS and Android platforms.

Stay tuned.

To build on Mac OSX you will need to install MoltenVK and set VULKAN_SDK_PATH as an environemnt variable 
ex.
```
export VULKAN_SDK_PATH='~/VulkanSDK/1.3.231.1' in .zprofile
```
(.bash profile/.zprofile if running cmake from command line)
